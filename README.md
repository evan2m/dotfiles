These are my personal configuration files. They include config files for 

 * vim
 * zsh (with oh-my-zsh)
 * tmux 
 * git
 * pentadactyl

To install (backup old configuration!):

Clone to wherever you wish:

    $ git clone --recursive git://github.com/evan2m/dotfiles.git

Install (creates symlinks to your home folder)

    $ cd dotfiles
    $ ./install.sh

Much of the configuration has been copied from [Steve Losh](http://stevelosh.com/)
and his [dotfiles].
