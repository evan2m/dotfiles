These are my personal configuration files. They include config files for vim, zsh (with oh-my-zsh), tmux and git.

To install (backup old configuration!):

Clone to wherever you wish:

    $ git clone --recursive git://evan2m@github.com/evan2m/dotfiles.git

Install (creates symlinks to your home folder)

    $ cd dotfiles
    $ ./install.sh
